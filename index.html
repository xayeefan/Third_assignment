            <p>Hi^_^, all. This is my assignment <b>3</b>…  still struggling(´･_･`)<br/>
                <br/>When I began to envision my final project, I first considered, whether could my project be used for myself while fulfilling monetization. With this in mind, I started to think about what are <b><u>the biggest pain points</u></b> of need in my usual daily life scenarios. As I was feeling unable to get my thoughts off my chest, I planned to order a cup of coffee to pass the time. When I opened my phone, I began to struggle with what coffee shops were nearby. And what items do they offer? How would I know if this shop had my favourite hazelnut latte?<br/>
                <br/>So is it possible that most coffee lovers share this pain point of need? With this question in mind, I interviewed <b><u>two types of personas</u></b>. One persona type is the group of my colleagues from my previous internship company, as we would often go to the coffee shop together after lunch to order coffee. The pleasant conversation awakened a memory of how we were often at a loss as to which coffee we needed to order each time, especially when we already had a clear idea of the type of coffee we wanted, but were worried that the shop we walked to after a long crawl may didn't satisfy our needs. If only there was a website that could tell us where the nearest takeaway coffee shop is. If there was a website that could tell us where the nearest takeaway coffee shop was and details of the shop's coffee list, we could buy coffee more quickly during our lunch break without having to search through various apps.<br/>
                <br/>With this in mind, I started my coffee website research...
